            I've had a lifelong passion and curiosity for technology. After
            high-school, I tried sticking around my rural hometown but I
            realised the quiet life wasn't for me. I made the move to Melbourne,
            Victoria to pursue a career in tech and what a journey it's been.

                is to chart the share prices of any american company across
                different time periods. I also added a second chart with a form
