            I've had a lifelong passion and curiosity for technology. After
            high-school, I tried sticking around my rural hometown but I
            realised the quiet life wasn't for me. I made the move to Melbourne,
            Victoria to pursue a career in tech and what a journey it's been.

            My first stop was RMIT to earn the Associate Degree in Information
            Technology. My second stop, General Assembly, where I studied their
            Software Engineering Immersive course for a rollercoaster 12 weeks.

                When planning this project, I felt my grasp on React wasn't
                strong enough. I thought the best way to learn something is to
                just dive in and do it so that's what I did. This apps purpose
                is to chart the share prices of any american company across
                different time periods. I also added a second chart with a form
                that shows you what an investment in that company would look
                like today.

                features I added to the game were a score counter and the option

                This was my first group project and we all had a blast building
                it. Developing with React for the first time was tough, so
                getting the map to behave the way we wanted was a real fist-pump
                moment. The map allows users to highlight countries they wish to
                visit or have visited.
