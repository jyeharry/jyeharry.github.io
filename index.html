          <br>
          <p class="lead">I've had a lifelong passion and curiosity for technology. After high-school, I tried sticking around my rural hometown but I realised the quiet life wasn't for me. I made the move to Melbourne, Victoria to pursue a career in tech and what a journey it's been.</p>
          <p class="lead">My first stop was RMIT to earn the Associate Degree in Information Technology. My second stop, General Assembly, where I studied their Software Engineering Immersive course for a rollercoaster 12 weeks.</p>
          <p class="lead">Over the last few years, I've learnt a wide range of software engineering skills and I'm excited to see what future holds for me!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p class='lead'>Here are some of the projects I've on worked in the past, either on my own or as a collaborator. None of these projects are truly 'finished'; I hope to continue adding more features to them as my skills grow.</p>

              <h4>TicTacToe</h4>
              <p class='lead'>A classic game that everyone knows. This was my first project at General Assembly and it was designed to test out knowledge of basic <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>, as well as <strong>Javascript/jQuery</strong>. Additional features I added to the game were a score counter and the option for players to choose an emoji for their token.</p>

            <div class='project-body'>
              <h4>BarHop</h4>
              <p class='lead'>BarHop was built using <strong>Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, the Google Places API and deployed to Heroku</strong>. The app allows users to search a suburb or street and have a list of bars and nightclubs in that area be returned to them in a card format, to make choosing their next social outing easier. Users can also sign up to save bars they like.</p>

            <div class='project-body'>
              <h4>Travel Tracker</h4>
              <p class='lead'>This was my first group project and we all had a blast building it. Built using <strong>React, Rails and 'react-jvectormap'</strong>. Developing with React for the first time was tough, so getting the map to behave the way we wanted was a real fist-pump moment. The map allows users to highlight countries they wish to visit or have visited. <strong>Note: use email jyeh@ga.co and password 'chicken' to sign in and try the map.</strong></p>

            <div class='project-body'>
              <h4>Investment Calculator</h4>
              <p class='lead'>When planning this project, I felt my grasp on React wasn't strong enough. I thought the best way to learn something is to just dive in and do it so that's what I did. Using <strong>React, Chart.js and the AlphaVantage API</strong>, I built an app that can chart the share prices of any american company across different time periods. I also added a second chart with a form that shows you what an investment in that company would look like today.</p>
